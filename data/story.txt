Good morning, my name is SB. This is my 2333th day in "Stone Book College", and yes, I am a super-super-super senior. 
Been a super-super-super senior is not as hard as it sounds except when you have to deal with "Eastern-Side Dining" for over 6 years. 

"Sigh... Do you know how important food is to a person? 
Do you know the standard calorie intake for a cutie like me?"
"Without enough nutrition, I will have a bad memory. Which means I will fail my Computer Science 219 midterm today. Failing a mid-term means failing the course. If I fail the course, it will ruin my GPA. I will get kicked out of my major if I GPA got ruined..."

"Wait... so... without enough nutrition == failed life?? Emmm ok." 

"It's just another day, let's go grab some food......"
